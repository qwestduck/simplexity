Simplexity by William Panlener

The goal of this project was to implement an AI that utilizes alphabeta pruning to play the game simplexity.

* Build the program with make
* Clean intermediate object files with make clean
* Execute ./simplexity for further usage instructions

The AI choices are not entirely correct. It will place itself in danger of losing (by placing three circles in a row for example) in an attempt to reach a winning move.
